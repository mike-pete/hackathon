      About the job
About The Team

The Codex App team builds and maintains the Codex desktop app and IDE extension — the primary ways developers interact with Codex. Our goal is to make AI feel like a real software engineering teammate inside real workflows: editing code, running tasks, reviewing changes, and coordinating long-running work.

We sit at the intersection of research, product, and design. We ship quickly, learn from real usage, and continuously refine both the experience and the harness that connects users to the model.

About The Role

We’re hiring a Frontend Software Engineer to build a top-tier desktop experience and push forward the interface for working with agents. This is a craft-heavy role: you’ll partner closely with design to prototype, iterate, and polish new interaction models — then turn them into reliable, high-performance product.

You’ll help define what great looks like for “human ↔ agent” collaboration: what belongs in the UI, how state is represented, how progress and uncertainty are communicated, and how users stay oriented across long-running and multi-step work.

What You’ll Do

Build and ship polished, high-performance UI across the Codex desktop app and IDE extension.
Partner tightly with design to turn prototypes into production-quality experiences (layout, motion, typography, interaction details).
Iterate on future interfaces for interacting with agents: delegation, task timelines, status/progress, handoffs, review, and control surfaces.
Own frontend architecture decisions (component systems, state management, navigation, rendering performance).
Improve quality and reliability through testing, instrumentation, and thoughtful UX for failure modes.
Collaborate with platform/model/backend partners to integrate new capabilities into cohesive product flows.

You Might Thrive Here If You

Have strong experience with modern frontend stacks (React, TypeScript) and a high bar for UI craft.
Love design engineering: sweating the details while keeping velocity.
Have built desktop-caliber product experiences (Electron or similar), and care about performance, responsiveness, and “it just feels right.”
Enjoy exploring ambiguous problems and iterating rapidly with design and product.
Think in end-to-end workflows, not isolated screens.
Have experience with developer tools or IDE extensions (nice-to-have).
